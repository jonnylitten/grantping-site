    <h1>Federal Grants for Environmental and Conservation Nonprofits</h1>

<p>If you run an environmental or conservation nonprofit, federal grants can provide critical funding for habitat restoration, clean water projects, climate resilience initiatives, and environmental education programs.</p>

<p>But finding these opportunities can be overwhelming. Grants.gov lists thousands of opportunities, and many environmental nonprofits miss deadlines simply because they don't know a grant exists.</p>

<p>That's where GrantPing comes in.</p>

<h2>Major Federal Grant Programs for Environmental Nonprofits</h2>

<p>Environmental nonprofits can access funding from multiple federal agencies. Here are the most significant programs:</p>

<h3>1. EPA Environmental Education Grants</h3>
<p>The <strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong> offers competitive grants to support environmental education projects that promote environmental awareness and stewardship. Typical awards range from $50,000 to $100,000.</p>

<h3>2. NOAA Coastal and Marine Habitat Restoration Grants</h3>
<p>The <strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</strong> provides funding through its Community-based Restoration Program and other initiatives. Projects include wetland restoration, oyster reef rebuilding, and coral reef conservation. Grants typically range from $100,000 to $500,000.</p>

<h3>3. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Programs</h3>
<p>The <strong>USDA NRCS</strong> offers conservation grants including the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) and the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). These support sustainable agriculture, water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat conservation. Awards can exceed $1 million for collaborative projects.</p>

<h3>4. National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) Grants</h3>
<p>While not directly federal, <strong>NFWF</strong> distributes federal funds from agencies like the EPA, NOAA, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Programs include pollinator habitat restoration, coastal resilience, and clean water initiatives. Grants range from $50,000 to $2 million.</p>

<h3>5. U.S. Forest Service Community Forest and Open Space Program</h3>
<p>This program provides funding to protect community forests from conversion to non-forest uses. Grants typically range from $100,000 to $400,000 and require matching funds.</p>
