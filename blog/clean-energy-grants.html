    <h1>DOE Grants for Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency</h1>

<p>Nonprofits, municipalities, universities, and businesses working on clean energy and climate solutions can access billions in federal funding from the Department of Energy (DOE), EPA, USDA, and other agencies. These grants support renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency, weatherization, clean transportation, and climate innovation.</p>

<p>Clean energy grants support the transition to a low-carbon economy while creating jobs and reducing energy costs. Staying informed about funding opportunities helps accelerate clean energy deployment in communities nationwide.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps clean energy organizations track federal funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Major Federal Clean Energy Grant Programs</h2>

<h3>1. DOE Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)</h3>
<p>The <strong>WAP</strong> provides formula grants to states for home weatherization serving low-income households. State and local agencies distribute funding to weatherization providers. Typical provider awards range from $500,000 to $5 million annually.</p>

<h3>2. DOE State Energy Program (SEP)</h3>
<p>The <strong>SEP</strong> provides formula funding to states for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. States issue competitive grants to local governments, nonprofits, and businesses for projects ranging from $50,000 to $2 million.</p>

<h3>3. DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) Grants</h3>
<p><strong>SETO</strong> funds solar energy research, development, and deployment. Competitive awards range from $500,000 to $10 million for community solar, solar workforce training, and technology innovation.</p>

<h3>4. EPA Environmental Justice Community Change Grants</h3>
<p>The <strong>EPA</strong> funds community-based organizations implementing clean energy and pollution reduction projects in disadvantaged communities. Awards range from $500,000 to $2 million.</p>

<h3>5. USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)</h3>
<p><strong>REAP</strong> provides grants and loans to rural businesses and agricultural producers for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. Grants can cover up to 50% of project costs, typically $2,500 to $500,000.</p>
