    <h1>FEMA Grants for Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Resilience</h1>

<p>State and local emergency management agencies, nonprofits, and communities can access federal funding from FEMA, HUD, NOAA, and other agencies for emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation, climate resilience, and recovery planning. These grants support everything from emergency operations centers to flood mitigation projects, community warning systems to evacuation planning.</p>

<p>As climate change increases disaster frequency and severity, federal investment in preparedness and resilience continues to grow. Staying informed about funding opportunities helps communities reduce risk and build capacity to respond to emergencies.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps emergency management agencies and resilience organizations track federal funding.</p>
