    <h1>Federal Grants for STEM Education Programs</h1>

<p>STEM education is a federal funding priority. Whether you run an afterschool robotics program, a summer coding camp, or a K-12 science initiative, billions of dollars in federal grants support STEM learning each year.</p>

<p>The challenge? Finding the right opportunities and meeting tight deadlines. STEM grants are highly competitive, and organizations that don't monitor opportunities daily often miss their chance.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps STEM educators and nonprofits stay on top of federal funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Major Federal STEM Grant Programs</h2>

<h3>1. NSF Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST)</h3>
<p>The <strong>National Science Foundation</strong> ITEST program funds projects that prepare K-12 students and teachers for careers in STEM fields. Awards typically range from $500,000 to $1.5 million over 3 years.</p>

<h3>2. Department of Education STEM Discretionary Grants</h3>
<p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Education</strong> offers competitive grants including the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) program and Education Innovation and Research (EIR) grants. Awards range from $500,000 to $4 million.</p>

<h3>3. NASA STEM Education and Accountability Projects</h3>
<p><strong>NASA</strong> funds education programs that engage students in authentic STEM experiences. Programs include the Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) and Space Grant Consortium. Awards range from $100,000 to $750,000.</p>

<h3>4. 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC)</h3>
<p>This <strong>Department of Education</strong> program provides funding for afterschool and summer enrichment programs with strong STEM components. State-administered grants typically award $50,000 to $400,000 per year to local organizations.</p>
