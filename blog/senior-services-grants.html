    <h1>Federal Grants for Senior Centers and Aging Services</h1>

<p>Senior centers, Area Agencies on Aging, and nonprofits serving older adults can access federal funding through the Administration for Community Living (ACL), HRSA, and other agencies. These grants support nutrition programs, caregiver support, elder justice, chronic disease self-management, and evidence-based health promotion.</p>

<p>As the U.S. population ages, federal investment in aging services continues to grow. Staying current with funding opportunities ensures your organization can serve more older adults and their families.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps aging services organizations track federal funding opportunities.</p>
