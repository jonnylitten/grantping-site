    <h1>Federal Grants for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment</h1>

<p>Substance abuse treatment and prevention programs receive billions in federal funding annually to address the opioid crisis, support recovery, prevent youth substance use, and expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the primary federal funder, along with CDC, DOJ, and other agencies.</p>

<p>These grants support residential treatment facilities, outpatient programs, prevention coalitions, recovery community organizations, and harm reduction initiatives. Missing funding opportunities means fewer people receiving life-saving treatment.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps substance abuse treatment and prevention organizations track federal funding.</p>
