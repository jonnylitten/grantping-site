    <h1>CDBG and Community Development Grants</h1>

<p>Community development organizations, municipalities, and nonprofits can access federal funding for neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure improvements, economic development, and services for low- and moderate-income residents through Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and other programs.</p>

<p>CDBG alone distributes over $3 billion annually to communities across America. Additional funding comes from the Economic Development Administration, HUD's Choice Neighborhoods, and other federal initiatives.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps community development organizations track these funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Major Federal Community Development Grant Programs</h2>

<h3>1. HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)</h3>
<p>The <strong>CDBG program</strong> is the largest federal community development program, providing formula grants to entitlement communities and states. Competitive CDBG grants are also available for specific initiatives, ranging from $500,000 to $5 million.</p>

<h3>2. EDA Public Works and Economic Adjustment Assistance</h3>
<p>The <strong>Economic Development Administration</strong> funds infrastructure projects that support economic development, job creation, and regional competitiveness. Awards typically range from $500,000 to $10 million.</p>

<h3>3. HUD Choice Neighborhoods Initiative</h3>
<p><strong>Choice Neighborhoods</strong> transforms distressed public and assisted housing into mixed-income communities. Planning grants award up to $500,000; implementation grants range from $20 million to $50 million.</p>

<h3>4. HUD Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program</h3>
<p>This program allows CDBG entitlement communities to borrow against future CDBG allocations for large-scale economic development and infrastructure projects. Loans can reach $35 million or more.</p>

<h3>5. USDA Community Facilities Direct Loan and Grant Program</h3>
<p><strong>USDA Rural Development</strong> funds essential community facilities in rural areas. Grants cover up to 75% of project costs, with awards ranging from $50,000 to $2 million.</p>
