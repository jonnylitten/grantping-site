    <h1>HUD Grants for Affordable Housing Development</h1>

<p>Affordable housing developers, community development corporations, housing authorities, and nonprofits can access billions in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other agencies. These grants support new construction, rehabilitation, homeownership programs, rental assistance, and supportive housing.</p>

<p>Affordable housing grants are highly competitive and often require matching funds, development experience, and complex compliance. Staying informed about funding opportunities is essential to creating housing for low-income families and individuals.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps affordable housing developers track federal funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Major Federal Affordable Housing Grant Programs</h2>

<h3>1. HUD HOME Investment Partnerships Program</h3>
<p>The <strong>HOME program</strong> provides formula grants to states and localities for affordable housing development, rehabilitation, and tenant-based rental assistance. Local jurisdictions distribute funds to developers. Typical project awards range from $500,000 to $5 million.</p>

<h3>2. HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) - Housing Activities</h3>
<p><strong>CDBG</strong> funds can support housing rehabilitation, homeownership assistance, and affordable housing development. Entitlement communities and states allocate CDBG funding to housing projects.</p>

<h3>3. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)</h3>
<p>While not a grant, <strong>LIHTC</strong> is the primary federal tool for affordable rental housing development. State housing finance agencies allocate tax credits to developers. A typical 9% LIHTC project can generate $10-20 million in equity.</p>

<h3>4. HUD Housing Trust Fund (HTF)</h3>
<p>The <strong>HTF</strong> provides funding for extremely low-income housing development. Formula grants to states support new construction and rehabilitation. Typical project awards range from $750,000 to $3 million.</p>

<h3>5. HUD Housing Counseling Grants</h3>
<p>These grants support nonprofit housing counseling agencies providing homeownership, rental, foreclosure prevention, and homeless counseling. Awards range from $50,000 to $500,000.</p>
