    <h1>HUD Grants for Homeless Services and Shelters</h1>

<p>Organizations providing homeless services—emergency shelters, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, and case management—rely on federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other agencies.</p>

<p>HUD's Continuum of Care (CoC) program alone distributes over $3 billion annually to homeless service providers. Missing application deadlines or not understanding funding priorities can mean the difference between securing housing for families and turning them away.</p>

<p>GrantPing ensures homeless service providers never miss critical funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Major Federal Homeless Services Grant Programs</h2>

<h3>1. HUD Continuum of Care (CoC) Program</h3>
<p>The <strong>Continuum of Care Program</strong> is the largest federal homeless assistance program. It funds permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, transitional housing, and supportive services. Annual awards range from $100,000 to several million dollars for established providers.</p>

<h3>2. Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG)</h3>
<p><strong>ESG</strong> funds emergency shelter operations, rapid rehousing, homelessness prevention, and outreach services. Formula grants go to states and cities, which then distribute funding to local nonprofits. Typical awards range from $50,000 to $500,000.</p>

<h3>3. HUD Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP)</h3>
<p>This program supports communities developing coordinated responses to youth homelessness. Awards range from $1 million to $10 million for comprehensive system planning and implementation.</p>

<h3>4. HUD Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA)</h3>
<p><strong>HOPWA</strong> provides housing assistance and supportive services for people living with HIV/AIDS. Formula and competitive grants range from $100,000 to $2 million.</p>

<h3>5. VA Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Department of Veterans Affairs</strong> funds rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention for veteran families. Awards typically range from $200,000 to $1.5 million.</p>
