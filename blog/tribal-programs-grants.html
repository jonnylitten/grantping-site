    <h1>Federal Grants for Tribal Governments and Native American Programs</h1>

<p>Tribal governments, Alaska Native villages, Native Hawaiian organizations, and nonprofits serving Native communities can access federal funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Indian Health Service (IHS), HUD, DOJ, and dozens of other agencies. These grants support healthcare, housing, education, economic development, infrastructure, and cultural preservation.</p>
