    <h1>NEA and Federal Grants for Arts and Culture Organizations</h1>

<p>Arts and culture organizations—from community theaters to art museums, symphonies to folk art centers—can access significant federal funding through the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and other agencies.</p>

<p>But arts grants are highly competitive and have specific application cycles. Knowing when funding opportunities open is critical to securing support for your programs.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps arts organizations stay informed about federal funding opportunities.</p>
