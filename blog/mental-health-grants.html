    <h1>SAMHSA and Federal Mental Health Service Grants</h1>

<p>Mental health and behavioral health organizations provide critical services to individuals experiencing mental illness, emotional disturbances, and co-occurring disorders. Federal grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HRSA, and other HHS agencies fund treatment programs, crisis services, prevention initiatives, and workforce development.</p>
