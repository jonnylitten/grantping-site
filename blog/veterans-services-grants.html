    <h1>VA and Federal Grants for Veterans Services</h1>

<p>Organizations serving veterans and military families can access federal funding for homeless services, employment assistance, mental health treatment, legal services, and supportive programs. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, and other agencies invest heavily in veteran-focused programs.</p>

<p>These grants support everything from transitional housing to job training, PTSD treatment to financial counseling. Staying informed about funding opportunities is essential to serving those who served our nation.</p>

<p>GrantPing helps veterans service organizations track federal funding opportunities.</p>
